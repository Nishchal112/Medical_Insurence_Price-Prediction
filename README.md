#🏥 Medical Insurance Price Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This notebook predicts individual medical insurance charges based on personal attributes like age, BMI, smoking habits, gender, and region. It demonstrates the use of Linear Regression and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.

✨ Key Highlights

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical features

📊 EDA & Visualization: Understand feature distributions and correlations

🤖 Prediction Model: Linear Regression to predict insurance charges

📈 Model Evaluation: R² score to check prediction accuracy

🛠 Technologies & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation 🧮

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization 📉

Scikit-learn for modeling ⚙️

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle (Insurance dataset)

Features include: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges
